## Hello! 

The web has always been such a fun place to create! I’ve been building sites since the days of slicing them in Photoshop and dropping them into tables in Dreamweaver back in 1998. Flash was a total blast in 2001—grabbing attention with animations in just seconds felt like magic!
Hello iPhone, 2007. Then came CSS and SEO around 2010, making search and design smarter. By 2014, I was zooming through website builds with Wix so fast that I launched a web development business practically overnight—and even trained others on the platform!
Something stirred deep in my bones in 2016. I looked at all these apps popping up and thought, where do I even start? But I knew apps weren’t going anywhere—and I knew I could learn.
I started small with a Swift Playgrounds class at the Apple Store using my new iPad. Then, in 2017, I dove into The Flatiron School. I had a one-year-old at the time, so my learning pace was… let’s say, “flexible.” But I kept going, driven by curiosity and excitement.
The rest of my journey is here in my commits. The gaps? Those are the times I’m working full-time (not coding, though it’s a dream!) and being a full-time mom too.
Thanks for reading—I love this stuff! Thank you, Steve Jobs! Thank you, Avi Flombaum!
