## Hello! 

The web is a really fun place to make content! I have been creating sites since we sliced them in Photoshop and added them to tables in Dreamweaver in 1998. Flash was a blast in 2001! It was great grabbing the attention of the consumer in seconds with animations! 

<b>Hello iPhone in 2007</b>. Then, we got smart, CSS and SEO were introduced in 2010 to help us with our search queries in Google. In 2014 I had a blast building websites superfast with the Wix platform, so fast I built a web development business overnight and trained others on the Wix software suite! 

I got this feeling <i>deep</i> in my bones in 2016. I thought about the iPhone and how all the new apps were built and I had no idea where to start, but I knew the apps were not going anywhere. I knew I could learn! 

So I took a Swift Playgrounds class at the Apple Store with my new iPad. Then started The Flatiron School in 2017. I had a 1 year old at the time so my learning pace was not focused nor ideal. But I kept at it.
The rest is here in my commits. The times I have no commits are times I am working full-time (not-coding, but it is a dream!) and being a full-time mom too.

Thanks for reading, I love this stuff! Thanks STEVE JOBS! Thanks Avi Flombaum!
